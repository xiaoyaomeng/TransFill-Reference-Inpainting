# TransFill-Reference-Inpainting
This is the official repo for TransFill: : Reference-guided Image Inpainting by Merging Multiple Color and Spatial Transformations at CVPR'21. According to some product reasons, we are not planning to release the training/testing codes and models. However, we will release the dataset and the scripts to prepare the dataset.
