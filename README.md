# TransFill-Reference-Inpainting
This is the official repo for TransFill: Reference-guided Image Inpainting by Merging Multiple Color and Spatial Transformations at CVPR'21. According to some product reasons, we are not planning to release the training/testing codes and models. Online-demo will be public once we set up the server. However, we will release the testing dataset for comparsion, and the scripts to prepare the training dataset.
